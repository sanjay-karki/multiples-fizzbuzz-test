## :page_with_curl:	Problem:
**_Using JavaScript, write a program that prints the number from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, & for multiples of five, print "Buzz". However, for numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead._**
